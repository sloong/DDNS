# sDDNS

If you have dynamic public ip address, and want access your service by the address, you can use the DDNS service. 
now have many of DDNS serivce and easy to use it. but free and access quick not so much. so we can use the normal dns service, such as AliDNS. 
this software can monitor the public ip change, and update the new ip address to dns service.
